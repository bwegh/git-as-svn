The problem of combining Git and Subversion work style with a version control system can be solved in different ways.

== GitHub Subversion support

This is probably the closest analogue.

The main problem of this implementation is inseparable from GitHub.
Also, all of a sudden, this implementation does not support Git LFS.

In the case of GitHub it is also not clear where the stored mapping between Subversion-revision and Git-commit.
This can be a problem when restoring repositories after emergency situations.

Quite an interesting implementation which supports master-master replication with Git and Subversion repositories.
Thereby providing synchronization of repositories is not clear.

== Subversion repository and git-svn

This method allows you to use Git with Subversion repository, but using a shared Git repository between multiple developers very difficult.

At the same time, the developer has to use a specific command-line tool for working with the repository.
